# Mission_to_Mars

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to take a web app that was already developed and polish it up. The web app should include images, and information from a site by scraping its information. The information should focus on Mar's and its four hemispheres. Once all the new information and pics are in the app it needs to be reformated to fit everything.

## Results

The app was successfully scraped with all the new Mar's data using the Mission_to_Mars.ipynb, app.py, and scraping.py files. The new information contains all the pictures and properly formatted web app's.
